Some primitive JS/XML glue.  Contact shaver@netscape.com.

XMLParser: a thin wrapper around the parser APIs of James Clark's `expat'
           XML parser.

XMLGraph: JSClass that generates a simple JS object graph from XML.  This is
          NOT W3C Level 1 DOM compliant by any stretch of even my vivid
          imagination.

These objects may never show up in Mozilla, of course.
