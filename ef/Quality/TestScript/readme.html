<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Description</B></FONT>
<P>
This test script's main purpose is to test Electrical Fire.  It obviously,
with a few modifications, can be changed to test any Java Runtime.
<P>
The option <B>-uw</B> is to allow a wrapper class to be used to invoke
the tests.  You can provided your own wrapper class as long as it prints
out the following results, which the test script will use to determine
if a test pass or failed.
<P>
<PRE>
For passing tests, print "STATUS:Passed."
For failing tests, print "STATUS:Failed."
</PRE>
Any tests that don't print out these two results will cause the test
script to make the test result as a <B>Check Test</B>. 
<P>
The options <B>-workdir</B> and <B>-testroot</B> are JCK specific test
arguments.  You don't need to specify them by default.  The <B>-workdir</B>
argument is just a temp directory were some tests can perform I/O.  The
<B>-testroot</B> is a path to the html test description of a JCK test.
If you want to specify a testroot, you will need to give the url path.
<PRE>
For example, "-testroot file:/g:/JCK-114a".
