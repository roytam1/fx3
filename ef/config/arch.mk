#######################################################################

#
# Note: OS_TARGET should be specified on the command line for gmake.
# When OS_TARGET=WIN95 is specified, then a Windows 95 target is built.
# The difference between the Win95 target and the WinNT target is that
# the WinNT target uses Windows NT specific features not available
# in Windows 95. The Win95 target will run on Windows NT, but (supposedly)
# at lesser performance (the Win95 target uses threads; the WinNT target
# uses fibers).
#
# When OS_TARGET=WIN16 is specified, then a Windows 3.11 (16bit) target
# is built. See: win16_3.11.mk for lots more about the Win16 target.
#
# If OS_TARGET is not specified, it defaults to $(OS_ARCH), i.e., no
# cross-compilation.
#

#
# The following hack allows one to build on a WIN95 machine (as if
# s/he were cross-compiling on a WINNT host for a WIN95 target).
# It also accomodates for MKS's uname.exe.  If you never intend
# to do development on a WIN95 machine, you don't need this hack.
