<b><font size=+1>Show
Example - CD Autorun Screen Custom Installation Text File</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">The CD Autorun screen includes a button that,
when clicked, opens a text document that contains instructions for installing
Mozilla. You might want to include additional information in this document
that you want your users to know before they install Mozilla.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">For example, you could add information on your
products and services, and tell users how they can contact you for more
information. If you're planning to include installers for additional programs
as part of your Mozilla installer, this document is a great place to
tell your users about the additional programs you're providing.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">To edit the installation document:</font>
<dir>
<dir><font color="#000000">1. Locate the standard installation document,
called install.txt, in the C:\Program Files\Mozilla\CCK\CCKTool\Configs\Default\Workspace\Autorun
directory.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">2. Make a copy of this file and save it in your
C:\Program Files\Mozilla\CCK\CCKTool\Configs\<i> configname </i>\Workspace\Autorun
directory, where<i> configname </i>is the directory name that corresponds
to the configuration you are working with.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">3. Open the install.txt document using a standard
text editor, such as Wordpad.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">4. Edit the install.txt document and save your
changes.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">5. In the CCK Tool, go to the screen titled "Customize
the CD Autorun Screen."</font>
<p><font color="#000000">6. Under Custom Installation Text File, click
Choose File… and browse to the location of your custom install.txt file
to include it.</font></dir>
