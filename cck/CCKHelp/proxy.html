<h2>
<font face="Arial"><font size=-1>Customize Proxy Configurations</font></font></h2>
<font face="Arial"><font size=-1>Many organizations block access from the
Internet to their networks. This prevents outside parties from gaining
access to sensitive information. The protection is called a firewall.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>If your organization has a firewall,
the browser may need to go through a proxy server before connecting your
users to the Internet. The proxy server prevents outsiders from breaking
into your organization's private network.&nbsp;</font></font><a NAME="bitmap"></a>
<h4>

<hr><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>Default Network Proxy Configurations</font></font></h4>
<font face="Arial"><font size=-1><b>Direct connection to the Internet.</b>
Choose this if your users don't have to go through a proxy.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1><b>Manual proxy configuration.</b>
Choose this if your users don't have a proxy configuration file. Type the
name or numeric IP address of the proxy server for HTTP and FTP. Type each
proxy server's port number in the Port field.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>In the "No Proxy for:" field, type
the names of any domains that your users can connect to directly, bypassing
the proxy. For example, if you type "netscape.com", then the proxy is bypassed
each time your users view a web page from netscape.com.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>Domain names are the part of a URL
that contains the name of an organization, business, or school—such as
netscape.com or washington.org. If you use local host names without the
domain name, list them the same way. Use commas to separate multiple host
names. The wildcard character [*] cannot be used.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1><b>Automatic proxy configuration URL.</b>
Choose this if you have a proxy configuration file. Type the file's URL
in the field and click Reload.&nbsp;</font></font>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1><b>Feedback.</b> Click this button
to go to a web page where you can provide feedback about the CCK Tool.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1><b>Next.</b> Each time you click Next
in a CCK screen, the information you entered or changed on that screen
gets automatically saved with the selected configuration.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1><b>Exit.</b> Click this button to exit
the CCK Tool. The customizations you have specified in any preceding screens
will be saved, but information you have specified on the current screen
will not.&nbsp;</font></font>
