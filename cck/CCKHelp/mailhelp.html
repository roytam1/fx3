<h2>
<font face="Arial"><font size=-1>Customize Mozilla Mail</font></font></h2>
To customize mail, you must complete all fields on this screen. If you
leave some but not all fields blank, the system prompts you to complete
the blank fields.
<p>If you leave all the fields blank, the customized version of Mozilla
1.4.1 produced by CCK will not include any customized mail settings.
<p>For more information on customizing Mozilla Mail, see Preparing to
Customize Mozilla Mail and News&nbsp;&nbsp; in <i>Guide to Customizing
and Distributing Mozilla 1.4.1.</i>
<p>Click the Show Example buttons to see examples of the corresponding
customization.&nbsp;<a NAME="domain"></a>
<h4>

<hr>Domain</h4>
<b>Domain name</b>. Enter the default e-mail domain that you want to appear
in the Mozilla mail account settings. For example, if you enter "mach.net"
in this field, Mozilla automatically appends each user's name with "@mach.net"
when your users set up their accounts. The domain name field also determines
default values on the Identity screen of the Account Wizard.
<p><b>Display name</b>. Enter the mail account name that you want to appear
as the Mail Folder in the left frame of the main Mozilla Mail screen.
For example, "Mach Networks Mail".
<p><b>Mail provider</b>. Enter the text that you want to appear in the
New Account Setup screen, where users are prompted to select the type of
account that they would like to set up, such as a newsgroup, e-mail, or
Webmail. This screen includes a variety of options; choices include AOL
and Mozilla accounts, so the more specific you make this text, the more
helpful to your customer. For example, to be consistent with other choices
on this account setup list, you might enter a string such as "Macn Networks
Mail Account".&nbsp;<a NAME="incoming"></a>
<h4>

<hr>Incoming Server</h4>
The fields in this section enable you to specify the settings that appear
in the Server Settings screen for the Mozilla Mail Account settings.
<p><b>Server name.</b> Enter the name of the incoming server. For example:
machnet.mail.net
<p><b>Port number.</b> Enter the port for the incoming server. The standard
port number is 110.
<p><b>Server type.</b> Choose POP or IMAP. If you choose POP, you can also
choose to leave messages on the server even after the user deletes them
in the Mozilla Mail program.&nbsp;<a NAME="outgoing"></a>
<h4>

<hr>Outgoing Server (SMTP)</h4>
<b>Server Name. </b>Enter the name of the outgoing SMTP server, for example,
smtp.mach.net&nbsp;
<hr>
<p><b>Feedback.</b> Click this button to go to a web page where you can
provide feedback about the CCK Tool.
<p><b>Next.</b> Each time you click Next in a CCK screen, the information
you entered or changed on that screen gets automatically saved with the
selected configuration.
<p><b>Exit.</b> Click this button to exit the CCK Tool. The customizations
you have specified in any preceding screens are saved, but information
you have specified on the current screen is not saved.&nbsp;
