<h2>
<font face="Arial"><font size=-1>Create the Installer</font></font></h2>
<font face="Arial"><font size=-1>This screen allows you to select the Mozilla
components included with the installer. You can also use this screen to
specify two additional executable files that the installer runs after the
main installation completes.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>For more information creating, testing,
and distributing your installer, see "Preparing to Create the Installer"
and subsequent chapters in the <i>Guide to Customizing and Distributing
Mozilla 1.4.1.</i></font></font><a NAME="components"></a>
<h4>

<hr><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>Select Components</font></font></h4>
<font face="Arial"><font size=-1>Components listed with checkmarks beside
them are included in the installer. Click a component to see a description
of it. Click the checkbox beside a component to select or deselect it.&nbsp;</font></font><a NAME="components"></a>
<h4>

<hr><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>Provide Additional Components</font></font></h4>
<font face="Arial"><font size=-1>You should prepare any additional executable
files before you use CCK to specify their location and other information.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>When a user installs Mozilla, the
additional installers are automatically installed after the main Mozilla
installation completes. However, if a user chooses the Custom path when
installing Mozilla, it's possible to choose not to install the additional
components.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>For each component, you need to provide
this information:</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1><b>Component Path.</b> Click Choose
File, browse to the location of the executiable file, and click Open.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1><b>Component Description.</b> Enter
a concise description of the component and what it does. Users see this
text if they choose to perform a custom installation.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1><b>Component Size.</b> Enter a number
of kilobytes that’s approximately three times the size of the actual executable
file you specify. This ensures that the installer will have enough room
to expand and install the program on the user’s hard disk.&nbsp;</font></font>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1><b>Show Config Info.</b> Before you
build the installer, you should click this button and review your customizations
to ensure that everything is correct.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1><b>Feedback.</b> Click this button
to go to a web page where you can provide feedback about the CCK Tool.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1><b>Build Installer.</b> Click this
button to initiate the installer build process. After the installer has
been created, you should run it, verify all your customizations, and if
necessary run CCK again to make any corrections or additional customizations
that may be required.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1><b>Exit.</b> Click this button to exit
the CCK Tool. The customizations you have specified in any preceding screens
are saved.&nbsp;</font></font>
