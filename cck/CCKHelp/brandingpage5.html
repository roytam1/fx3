<p><font color="#330033">Sidebar is a customizable frame in the Mozilla&nbsp;
browser that provides access to popular items such as the latest news and
weather, address book or buddy list, stock quotes, a calendar, and many
other items that you can add. The sidebar presents these items in tabs
that it continually updates.</font>
<p><font color="#330033">Mozilla comes with some sidebar tabs already
set up, but you can customize the sidebar by adding, removing, and rearranging
tabs for your users.</font>
