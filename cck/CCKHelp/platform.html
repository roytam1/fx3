<h4>
<font face="Arial">Specify Operating System and Language</font></h4>
The CCK tool can generate an installer for use on Windows or Linux. It's
also possible to create a Macintosh installer by replacing some of the
standard Macintosh installation files with the equivalent installation
files produced for a Windows installer.
<p>For detailed information on generating a Mozilla installer for each
operating system, see "Preparing Platform and Installer Information"&nbsp;&nbsp;
in <i>Guide to Customizing and Distributing Mozilla 1.4.1.</i><a NAME="before_begin"></a>
<h4>

<hr><font face="Arial">Platform</font></h4>
<b>Windows.</b> To create a Windows installer,&nbsp; choose Windows from
the drop-down list and click Next to proceed through the other screens.
<p><b>Linux.</b> To create a Linux installer, choose Linux from the drop-down
list and specify the location of the Linux tar file as described below.
<p><b>Macintosh.</b> To prepare a Macintosh installer, you first use the
CCK tool to create a Windows installer, then follow the instructions in
"Preparing Macintosh Installers and Program Files" in <i>Guide to Customizing
and Distributing Mozilla 1.4.1.</i><a NAME="existing_or_new"></a>
<h4>

<hr><font face="Arial">Linux tar file</font></h4>
If you select Linux from the drop-down list, you should have previously
downloaded the Mozilla 1.4.1 Linux tar file named <tt>mozilla-i686-pc-linux-gnu-sea.tar.gz</tt><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>
to some convenient location. You can then specify the location of the tar
file in the space provided.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>If you are creating a Linux installer,
you must also have GNU Tools for Microsoft Windows (the Cygnus toolkit)
installed on the system before running the CCK tool. You can obtain the
Cygnus toolkit from <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">http://www.cygwin.com/</a>.
You must also make sure that the path to the binaries for the Cygwin Unix
programs is included in the Windows environment variable called PATH. To
check, open the System control panel and click the Environment tab.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>You need to specify the location of
the Linux tar file only once. After you do so, the CCK tool creates this
directory:</font></font>
<p><tt><i>installation_directory</i>\CCKTool\nscpxpiLinux\</tt>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>and stores the decompressed standard
Linux installation files there.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>After you finish running the CCK tool,
the tool creates the customized Linux build as a tar file in</font></font>
<p><tt><i>installation_directory</i>\CCKTool\Configs\<i>my_config</i>\Output\</tt>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>You can then transfer this tar file
to a Linux system and the extract the contents for testing. After you extract
the contents of the tar file, you must also change the permission of the
file mozilla-installer-bin to include executable permission. You can then
run the install script by typing </font></font><tt>./mozilla-installer</tt><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>.&nbsp;</font></font>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1><b>Feedback.</b> Click this button
to go to a web page where you can provide feedback about the CCK Tool.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1><b>Next.</b> Each time you click Next
in a CCK screen, the information you entered or changed on that screen
gets automatically saved with the selected configuration.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1><b>Exit.</b> Click this button to exit
the CCK Tool. When you click this button on the first screen, none of the
information you may have specified will be saved.&nbsp;</font></font>
