and many other items that users can add. Sidebar presents these items in
tabs that it continually updates.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>Mozilla 1.4.1 comes with some sidebar
tabs already set up. To provide your own sidebar tab in your customized
browser, you first create a tab, which is simply an HTML document. For
more detailed information on this topic, see Creating Your Own Sidebar
Tab&nbsp; in the <i>Guide to Customizing and Distributing Mozilla 1.4.1.</i></font></font><i><font face="Arial"><font size=-1></font></font></i>
