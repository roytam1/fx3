   <title>Welcome to the Mozilla Client Customization Kit (CCK)!</title>
</head>
<body>
Using the CCK tool
is the easiest and fastest way to customize Mozilla and build a customized
Mozilla 1.4.1 installer. If you've never used the CCK tool before, it's
a great way to familiarize yourself with the most popular customizations
and the customization process.
<p><i>Guide to Customizing and Distributing Mozilla 1.4.1&nbsp;</i> provides
detailed information about the CCK tool as well as information about additional
customizations you can perform manually. You can find this document on
the website: <!-- XXX need a mozilla.org equivalent!  http://home.netscape.com/eng/mozilla/ns7/CCKDocs/guide.html -->
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>

<hr><font face="Arial">Select an Existing Configuration or Create a New
One</font></h4>
If you are modifying an existing configuration, you must select its name
from the drop-down menu near the bottom left of the welcome screen before
proceeding.
<p><b>Show Config Info.</b> Click this button to see what customizations
you've already completed for the configuration whose name is currently
displayed to the left.
<p><b>New Configuration.</b> Click this button to create a new configuration.
(You will need to do this if this is your first time running the CCK tool.)
Enter the name of your configuration in the Create New Configuration dialog
box and click Create New Configuration. The CCK tool then creates a new
directory using the name you entered for the new configuration.
<p>The CCK tool creates your new configuration directory in the location
<p><i>installation_directory</i><tt>\CCKTool\Configs\</tt><i><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>my_config</font></font></i>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>where <i>installation_directory</i>
is the directory you specified while installing the tool, and <i>my_config</i>
is the configuration name you specified after clicking New Configuration
as described above.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>Within your new configuration directory,
the CCK tool automatically creates the Output and Workspace subdirectories.
The Output directory is where the CCK tool will create your customized
Mozilla installer. You can use the Workspace directory as a convenient
place in which to store your customized files. It contains the following
subdirectories:</font></font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=-1>AnimLogo directory: stores the four </font></font><tt>.GIF</tt><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>
files associated with the animated logo button.</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=-1>Autorun directory: stores a custom background
image for the CD Autorun screen.</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=-1>Bkmarks directory: stores a custom bookmarks
file for the Navigator browser.</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=-1>CustInst directory: stores additional
installers (in the form of self-extracting executable files) that will
run after the main installation completes.</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial"><font size=-1>Sidebar directory: stores the custom sidebar
panels file</font></font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Arial"><font size=-1>For more information about the configuration
directory, read the chapter in Use the Configuration Workspace for Customized
Files in the <i>Guide to Customizing and Distributing Mozilla 1.4.1. </i></font></font>You
can find this document on the website: <!-- XXX need moz.org equiv! http://home.netscape.com/eng/mozilla/ns7/CCKDocs/guide.html. -->
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1><b>Create a Copy.</b> Click this button
to create a copy of the currently selected configuration. This option lets
you create a new customized installer, based on an existing configuration,
without overwriting the existing configuration (similar to a "Save As"
operation).&nbsp;</font></font>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1><b>Feedback.</b> Click this button
to go to a web page where you can provide feedback about the CCK Tool.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1><b>Next.</b> Each time you click Next
in a CCK screen, the information you entered or changed on that screen
gets automatically saved with the selected configuration.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1><b>Exit.</b> Click this button to exit
the CCK Tool. When you click this button on the first screen, none of the
information you may have specified will be saved.&nbsp;</font></font>
