<h2>
<font face="Arial"><font size=-1>Customize Mozilla News</font></font></h2>
To customize Mozilla News, you must complete all fields on this screen.
If you leave some but not all fields blank, the system prompts you to complete
the blank fields.
<p>If you leave all the fields blank, the customized version of Mozilla
1.4.1 produced by CCK will not include any customized News settings.
<p>For more information on customizing Mozilla News, see "Preparing to
Customize Mozilla Mail and News" in the <i>Guide to Customizing and Distributing
Mozilla 1.4.1.</i>
<p>Click the Show Example buttons to see examples of the corresponding
customization.&nbsp;<a NAME="domain"></a>
<h4>

<hr>Domain</h4>
<b>Domain name</b>. Enter the default News domain that you want to appear
in the Mozilla newsgroup account settings. Note that this domain name
must be different than the domain name you used for Mail. For example,
if your mail domain is "mach.net," News domain of "mach.news.net" would
work, but "mach.net" would not.
<p><b>Display name</b>. Enter the News account name that you want to appear
near the bottom of the left frame of the main Mozilla Mail screen. For
example, "Mach Networks News".
<p><b>News provider</b>. Enter the text that you want to appear in the
New Account Setup screen, where users are prompted to select the type of
account that they would like to set up, such as a newsgroup, e-mail, or
Webmail. This screen includes a variety of options; choices include AOL
and Mozilla accounts, so the more specific you make this text, the more
helpful to your customers. For example, to be consistent with other choices
on this account setup list, you might enter a string such as "Mach Networks
News Account".&nbsp;<a NAME="incoming"></a>
<h4>

<hr>News Server</h4>
The fields in this section enable you to specify the settings that appear
in the Server Settings screen for the Mozilla News Account Settings.
<p><b>Server name.</b> Enter the name of the News server. For example:
mach.news.net
<p><b>Port number.</b> Enter the port for the News server. The standard
port number is 119.&nbsp;
<hr>
<p><b>Feedback.</b> Click this button to go to a web page where you can
provide feedback about the CCK Tool.
<p><b>Next.</b> Each time you click Next in a CCK screen, the information
you entered or changed on that screen gets automatically saved with the
selected configuration.
<p><b>Exit.</b> Click this button to exit the CCK Tool. The customizations
you have specified in any preceding screens will be saved, but information
you have specified on the current screen will not.&nbsp;
