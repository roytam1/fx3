   <title>Customize the CD Autorun Screen</title>
</head>
<body>

<h2>
<font face="Arial"><font size=-1>Customize the CD Autorun Screen</font></font></h2>
If you selected "Include CD Autorun Screen" in the second CCK screen (called
Gathering Information), the default CA autorun screen will be included
in your custom installer unless you use this CCK screen to customize it.
If you didn't select "Include CD Autorun Screen" in the Gathering Information
screen, your custom installer will not install any CD autorun screen.
<p>If you decide to customize the CD autorun screen, you should prepare
the bitmap and text filees required before using CCK to specify their location.
For detailed information on preparing these files, see the <i>Guide to
Customizing and Distributing Mozilla 1.4.1.</i>
<p>Click the Show Example buttons to see examples of the corresponding
customizations. If you want to customize the CD autorun screen in ways
that aren't shown here, such as adding more screens or files, see the <i>Guide
to Customizing and Distributing Mozilla 1.4.1.</i><a NAME="bitmap"></a>
<h4>

<hr>Background Bitmap</h4>
<b>Path to your Background Image.</b> If you've stored your background
bitmap image somewhere other than the location shown, click Choose File,
browse to the location of the file, and click Open. To check the file that's
currently specified, click the View File button.&nbsp;<a NAME="title"></a>
<h4>

<hr>Title Bar Text</h4>
<b>Mozilla by.</b> Enter the text you want to appear in the title bar
of the CD Autorun Screen. For example, if you enter "Mach Networks" the
title bar text will read "Mozilla by Mach Networks".
<p><b>Display This Text Below the Title Bar.</b> Enter the text you want
to appear just below the title bar. For example: "Welcome to the Mach Networks
Installer for Mozilla 1.4.1."&nbsp;<a NAME="title"></a>
<h4>

<hr>Custom Installation Text File</h4>
The CD Autorun screen includes a button that, when clicked, opens a text
document containing instructions for installing Mozilla. You might want
to include additional information in this document that you want your users
to know before they install Mozilla 1.4.1.
<p><b>Path to Installation Text File (install.txt).</b> If you've stored
your installation text file somewhere other than the location shown, click
Choose File, browse to the location of the file, and click Open. To check
the file that's currently specified, click the View File button.&nbsp;
<hr>
<p><b>Feedback.</b> Click this button to go to a web page where you can
provide feedback about the CCK Tool.
<p><b>Next.</b> Each time you click Next in a CCK screen, the information
you entered or changed on that screen gets automatically saved with the
selected configuration.
<p><b>Exit.</b> Click this button to exit the CCK Tool. The tool saves
customizations you have specified in any preceding screens, but doesn't
save any information you have specified on the current screen.&nbsp;
