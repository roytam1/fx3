// This file defines the load collector class, which monitors requests using
// the document loader service and records the events into the metrics service.
//
// The load collector logs <document action="load"/> events.
// This event has the following attributes:
//
// origin: The action which initiated the load (string).  Possible values are:
//         "typed": The user typed or pasted the URI into the location bar.
//         "link": The user followed a link to the URI.
//         "reload": The user reloaded the URI.
//         "refresh": A meta-refresh caused the URI to be loaded.
//         "session-history": The user used back/forward to load the URI.
//         "global-history": The user selected the URI from global history.
//         "bookmark": The user selected the URI from bookmarks.
//         "external": An external application passed in the URI to load.
//         "other": Any origin not listed above.
//
// bfCacheHit: The document presentation was restored from the
//             session history cache (boolean).
//
// window: The id of the window where the document loaded (uint16).
// loadtime: The elapsed time for the load, in milliseconds (uint32).
