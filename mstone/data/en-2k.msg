In England nobody under the age of 18 is allowed to drink in a public
bar.Mr. Thompson used to go to a bar near his house quite often, but he
never took his son, Tom, because he was too young. Then when Tom had his
eighteenth birthday, Mr. Thompson took him to his usual bar for the first
time. They drank for half an hour, and then Mr. Thompson said to his son,
"Now, Tom, I want to teach you a useful lesson. You must always be careful
not to drink too much. And how you know when you've had enough? Well, I'll
tell you. Do you see those two lights at the end of the bar? When they seem
to have become four, you've had enough and should go home.""But , Dad," said
Tom, " I can only see one light at the end of the bar".
The wedding date was set and the groom's three pals, a carpenter, an
electrician, and a dentist, were deciding what pranks to play on the couple
on their wedding night.The carpenter decided that he would saw the slats off
their bed. The electrician figured that wiring the bed with alternating
current would give them a few chuckles. The dentist would not tell the
others what he had done, and wore a sly grin, simply suggesting that his gag
would be a memorable one. The wedding and reception went as planned. A few
days later, each of the groom's three friends received a letter which read
as follows. Dear friends, We didn't mind the bed slats being sawed. The
electric shock was only a minor setback. But, I swear to God Almighty, I'm
going to kill the idiot who put Novocain in the K-Y Jelly.
