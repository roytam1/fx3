<!-- hiddenwindow is a "minimal" XUL window intended for creating the,
     er, hidden window.  This window is never shown, but on platforms
     which leave the app running after the last (visible) window is shut
     down, this window does hold a browser menubar.
       Though this window looks a lot like navigator.xul, that xul
     is unsuitable because it's subject to the whims of its associated
     appcore, which among other things causes it to load content documents
     undesirable for this window.
       Arguably a simpler menu structure could be substituted, but
     the full one was included for now in anticipation of the whole thing
     becoming an included file someday. -->
