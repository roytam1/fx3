// This is our controller -- the thingy that listens to what the user
// is doing. There is one controller per browser window, and each has
// a BrowserView that manages information about problems within the
// window. The controller figures out when the browser might want to
// know about something, but the browser view figures out what exactly
// to do (and the BrowserView's displayer figures out how to do it).
//
// For example, the controller might notice that the user has switched
// to a tab that has something problematic in it. It would tell its 
// BrowserView this, and the BrowserView would figure out whether it 
// is appropriate to show a warning (e.g., perhaps the user previously
// dismissed the warning for that problem). If so, the BrowserView tells
// the displayer to show the warning. Anyhoo...
//
// TODO Could move all browser-related hide/show logic into the browser
//      view. Need to think about this more.
