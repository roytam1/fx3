jsPerformance.pl is an adaptation by mazielobo@netscape.com
of the JS Engine test driver (jsDriver.pl by rginda@netscape.com).

Whereas jsDriver.pl runs qualitative tests with pass-fail output,
jsPerformance.pl runs performance tests, with timing output.

The driver outputs results files as peers to the test driver, and like
jsDriver.pl, expects tests to be in a directory structure two levels deep.

Additionally, jsPerformance.pl can post to a CGI script for logging,
e.g. http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/webtools/graph/collect.cgi.
For convenience, we have included collect.cgi in mozilla/js/perf/.

You can use collect.cgi locally to log performance results over time
from one machine. If installed on a web server, many different machines
can log results to it. Note that collect.cgi depends on CGI modules
available at http://stein.cshl.org/WWW/software/CGI::modules/.

Note: the call to send_results_to_server() is currently commented out.
If you want to post results to collect.cgi, uncomment it as appropriate.
