THE ENTIRE CONTENTS OF THIS DIRECTORY HAS BEEN DELETED.

Replacement code is in mozilla/js/src/liveconnect.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
This directory previously contained the implementation of LiveConnect,
which is the marketing term for the glue between Java and JavaScript
that allows each language implementation to access the methods and
fields of the other one.

This code relied heavily on unpublished APIs to Netscape's Java VM and
hence will not work with any other VM.  This code has been entirely
supplanted by the code in mozilla/js/src/liveconnect, that makes use
of the Java Native Interface (JNI), which is JavaSoft's de facto
standard way of communicating with a Java VM.  (The old code does not
use JNI because it predated the existence of the JNI.)
