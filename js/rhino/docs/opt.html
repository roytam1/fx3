Optimization settings</H2>
<P>The currently supported optimization settings are:</P>

<P><B>-1</B>

<P><B></B>Interpretive mode is always 
used. The compilation time is minimized at the expense of runtime performance. 
No class files are generated, which may improve memory usage depending on your 
system.
<p>
If the optimization package is not available, then optimization acts as if it is always -1.
</P>

<P><B>0</B>

<P><B></B>No optimizations are 
performed. The bytecode compiler runs fastest in this mode, but the generated byte code 
is less efficient.</P>

<P><B>1-9</B>

<P>All optimizations are performed. Simple data &amp; type 
flow analysis is performed to determine which JavaScript variables can be 
allocated to Java VM registers, and which variables are used only as Numbers. 
Local common sub-expressions are collapsed (currently this only happens for 
property lookup, but in the future more expressions may be optimized). All local 
variables and parameters are allocated to Java VM registers. Function call 
targets are speculatively pre-cached (based on the name used in the source) so 
that dispatching can be direct, pending runtime confirmation of the actual 
target. Arguments are passed as Object/Number pairs to reduce conversion 
overhead.</P>

<P>Note:
<OL>
<LI>
Some language features (indirect calls to eval, use 
    of the arguments property of function objects) were previously not supported 
    in higher optimization levels. These features have been removed from the 
    language in ECMA, so higher optimization levels are now conformant.

<LI>
Future versions may allocate more aggressive 
    optimizations to higher optimization levels. For compatibility with future 
    versions, use level 1. For maximal optimization, use level 9, but retest 
    your application when upgrading to new versions.</LI>
