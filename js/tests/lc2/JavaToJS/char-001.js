/**
   File Name:      char-001.js
   Description:

   Java methods that return a char value should be read as a
   JavaScript number.

   To test this:

   1.  Call a method that returns a char.
   2.  Set the value of a JavaScript variable to the char value.
   3.  Check the value of the returned type, which should be "number"
   4.  Check the type of the returned type, which should be the Unicode
   encoding of that character.

   It is an error if the JavaScript variable is an object, or JavaObject
   whose class is java.lang.Character.
