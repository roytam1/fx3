/**
   File Name:      null-001.js
   Description:

   When accessing a Java field whose value is null, JavaScript should read
   the value as the JavaScript null object.

   To test this:

   1.  Call a java method that returns the Java null value
   2.  Check the value of the returned object, which should be null
   3.  Check the type of the returned object, which should be "object"
