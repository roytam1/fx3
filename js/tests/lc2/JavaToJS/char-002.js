/**
   File Name:      char-002.js
   Description:

   Java fields whose value is char should be read as a JavaScript number.

   To test this:

   1.  Instantiate a Java object that has fields with char values,
   or reference a classes static field whose value is a char.
   2.  Reference the field, and set the value of a JavaScript variable
   to that field's value.
   3.  Check the value of the returned type, which should be "number"
   4.  Check the type of the returned type, which should be a number

   It is an error if the JavaScript variable is an object, or JavaObject
   whose class is java.lang.Character.
