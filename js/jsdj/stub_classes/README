jsdj/stub_classes contains stubbed out versions of some Netscape classes which
might be needed for compatability. For instance, the graphical debugger (in
com.netscape.jsdebugging.ifcui) used the netscape.security calsses when running
in Navigator, but needs stubbed out versions of a couple of those classes to
function in a stand-alone environment.
