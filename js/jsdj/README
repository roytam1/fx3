/* jband - 09/14/98 -  */

js/jsdj contains virtually all of the Java code for JavaScript Debugging
(native parts of the code for JavaScript can be found in js/jsd).

This includes the full source to Netscape JavaScript Debugger, adapter parts,
jslogger, a simple console debugger, a test system, and some build tools.

The notable subdirs are:

build         - stuff to build the code
classes       - trees of source files
dist          - generated output dir
doc           - some documents
ifcui         - auxilary pieces of the JavaScript Debugger
jslogger      - auxilary pieces of a smaple JavaScript logging app
stub_classes  - stubbed out mozilla classes to allow standalone debugging
test          - a place for subsystem tests

The source to the debugger lives in:
    jsdj/classes/com/netscape/jsdebugging/ifcui

All building is done in:
    jsdj/build
