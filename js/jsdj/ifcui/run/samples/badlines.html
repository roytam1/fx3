<!-- 
    This sample demonstrates a file with
    'unusual' line terminators in which
    manual adjustment is necessary.

    Some mixed types of line terminators
    can cause the line parsing code in
    Communicator to send incorrect line
    number information to the debugger.
    It is not always possible for the 
    debugger to automatically adjust. 
    The debugger allows for manual 
    adjustment to allow you to compensate
    for this problem when it occurs.
    
    By doing a right drag in the left-most
    column, the 'marks' can be dragged up 
    or down to realign correctly with the 
    text. The adjustment will affect the
    line adjusted and the lines below it.
    
    Clicking the middle mouse button
    (or alt-click) in the left-most column
    will reset adjustments for the page
