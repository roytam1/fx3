com.netscape.nativejsengine is a package which allows starting and running the
native JavaScript engine from a Java application. It is very bare-bones --
intended ony to support testing. It supports starting the engine (with optional
debugger support), setting the version, sending rping output to the Java app,
and loading/executing .js files. The native code to complete this package lives
in js/jsd/javawrap.
