com.netscape.jsdebugging.ifcui is the graphical Netscape JavaScript Debugger.
This is the same code that previously lived in netscape.jsdebugger and was
shipped in 1.1 form. That *tested* product for Navigator 4.x can be downloaded
from:

  http://developer.netscape.com/software/jsdebug.html

This code can be used to run in Navigator or with the standalone JS engines.

This can be built on Windows and packaged in various ways using the build system
in js/jsdj/build.
