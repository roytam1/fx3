com.netscape.jsdebugging.api is the package which defines the interface used by
debugger(s) to access the debugging support in the JavaScript engine. It exists
to allow the very same debugger to be used with either the C based engine, the
Java based engine (Rhino), of with a remote engine accessed via Corba/iiop
(additional 'adapter' implementations might be added in the future). This
package presents the generic JS debug interface against which the debugger
compiles and runs.
