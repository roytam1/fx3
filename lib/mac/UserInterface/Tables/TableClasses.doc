This document describes the following classes:

LTableHeader			
LTableViewHeader	
LTableRowSelector	
LFlexTableGeometry	

There is also a description of how they can all be used together at the end.


---- LTableHeader ----

This subclass of LView implements a table header with resizable and movable columns.  
Column headers are individual panes within the view.  These panes are always positioned
appropriately to be in line with their columns.  The panes are resized horizontally to
touch the left and right edges of their columns.

The class also supports special appearance for the sorted column, chosen by clicking 
on a column header.

The header does NOT scroll.  Columns are always resized proportionally, though columns
can be marked as fixed width. The header's image size always matches its frame.


¥ Creation

The view has custom PPob and also requires a 'Cols' resource.  The data in the PPob
specifies the following information:

	header flags:				
		only 1, kHeaderCanHideColumns
	
	2 bevel trait resource ids:
		sorted column header, then unsorted
		
	reverse modifiers:
		an event record modifier mask that denotes a reverse-sort selection
		
	'Cols' resource ID:	
		id of 'Cols' resource, with column initialization data, REQUIRED
			

The 'Cols' resource is used to initialize the size and positioning of the header's 
columns.  The header of the resource (SavedHeaderState) is defined in LTableHeader.h.
Following the header is an array of ColumnData (also in LTableHeader.h) records, 1 
for each column.

The header of the resource specifies:
	
		# of columns						(1-based)
		index of rightmost visible column	(1-based)
		index of sorted column				(1-based, 0 if none)
		
		
Each ColumnData record specifies:

		Pane ID of column header, 0 if none
		
		Column Width
			In pixels if fixed size, in % of non-fixed space if resizable
			
		Column Position 
			Meaningless in saved state, ignore it.
			
		ColumnFlags
			kColumnDoesNotSort and/or kColumnDoesNotResize
	
	
¥ Header and Column Size
	
	If a column is fixed-width, it will always have that width. Widths of resizable 
	columns are maintained as percentages of the non-fixed space in the header.
	
	When a column is resized, all columns to its right resize proportionally.  

	
¥ Hiding/Showing Columns	

	If the kHeaderCanHideColumns flag is set in the header flags, the view will have
	a widget at the right edge for hiding and showing columns.
	
¥ Dragging/Resizing Columns

	To change the rgn that gets dragged when resizing or moving a column, override
	ComputeResizeDragRect or ComputeColumnDragRect respectively.
	
¥ Sorting

	When the sorted column changes, LTableHeader broadcasts a msg_SortedColumnChanged
	message, with TableHeaderSortChange parameter.
	
	The method GetSortedColumn returns both the index and the header pane ID of the
	sorted column.
	
	
	
	
		

---- LTableViewHeader ----

LTableViewHeader is a subclass of LTableHeader that coordinates changes in the header
with an LTableView.  

When columns are hidden or shown in the header, this class removes/adds columns from/to 
the table view.  

When the image size of the header changes, the image size of the table is adjusted as well. 

When columns are redrawn in the header, they are invalidated for refresh in the table view.

This class also overrides ComputeResizeDragRect and ComputeColumnDragRect to create more
useful regions when dragging and resizing columns.




---- LTableRowSelector ----

This subclass of LTableSelector selects entire rows.  Individual cells cannot be selected.
It allows multiple selection and supports that standard shift and command key selection 
extension semantics.




---- LFlexTableGeometry	----

This subclass of LTableGeometry works in concert with an LTableHeader to compute the position
of cells in a table.  All rows are of uniform height, and column positions and widths
are determined by querying the associated LTableHeader view.



---- Using them together	----

The Dogbert mail window will use these classes all together.  A subclass of LTableView
(CMessageTableView)  sets its geometry to LFlexTableGeometry, and its selector to
LTableRowSelector.

When drawing a cell, CMessageTableView queries its associate LTableViewHeader to find the
pane ID of the column's header.  The pane ID's denote which element of the row is drawn in 
that cell.  For instance, a column with header 'subj' contains the message subject. This
indirection allows the column order to be changed.
