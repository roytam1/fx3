This is Grendel -- a Java mail/news client.

It runs now, though there is still a lot of work to be done.

Grendel is maintained by R.J. Keller (rj.keller@beonex.com),
and Jeff Galyan (jeffrey.galyan@sun.com).

See http://www.mozilla.org/projects/grendel/ for more info.

Read README.build for build instructions
