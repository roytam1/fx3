This is Grendel -- a Java mail/news client.

The grendel.view package is what gathers together the messages in a
Folder, calculates a sorting/threading order on them, and allows for a
UI to present them.

Much of the UI work is in the "thread list" -- a scrollable list of
messages, possibly organized in a threaded tree, which the user can
scroll through and select and drag and manipulate.  Most of the smarts
of the "thread list" are really implemented here in the grendel.view
package.
