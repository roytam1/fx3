So that means that on Unix, you use sendmail (wearing its MDA hat
instead of its MTA hat) to move messages into /var/spool/mail/$USER ?

I think that's a totally reasonable thing to do.

(Well first off, fixing that is really hard, which is why I didn't just
do it.)

But I think, actually, that telling them that they need to configure
sendmail in that was *does* fly, because *most* people on Solaris do
that anyway -- the simple fact of life is that almost all Unix MUAs
expect /var/spool/mail/$USER to be in BSD Mailbox format, not in
Content-Length format.  It's not just Netscape.  If any Solaris user
wants to use a mailer other than one that Sun ships, they have to
reconfigure sendmail in this way.

> Fixing movemail is a much better solution.

That would be a nice solution, but you can't look at /var/mail/ and know
which of the two formats its in, so you need a new user option in the
client.  And its one that no end-user is going to know how to set.

And it only fixes the "Get Mail" case.  The thing that sucks most about
this, actually, is not the "Get Mail" case, but the fact that both Sun's
MailTool and Eudora write folder files using the Content-Length format;
they don't do From mangling.  So that means that importing folders is
dicey -- every now and then, a message will get split.

Movemail depends on From-mangling, because it assumes BSD format.
Mozilla has movemail code built-in, and also can use an external
program to do this.  

But, Mozilla *also* uses BSD format for its saved folders.  So if it's
pointed at a folder written by another program, and that other program
uses the Content-Length format, messages might get split.

No; this isn't an issue for Get-Mail-using-POP3, only for
Get-Mail-using-movemail (and for folders already on disk.)

> What are you going to do when you get a message from a Microsoft

Responses from POP3 servers need not be mangled; those are terminated by
`CRLF . CRLF' so there's no ambiguity (and then when we write that
message to disk, we write it in our native folder format, which is to
say, we mangle the internal From lines.)

Yes, I agree.  We don't have to tell them their server is broken,
because Get-Mail-via-POP3 isn't a problem for us.

In fact, in the Get Mail case, it's only an issue on Solaris, and only
when using movemail.  All other Unix platforms on which we ship come
with MDAs which use the BSD format, not the Content-Length format. 
Solaris can do either, but comes configured for Content-Length.

Why is supporting Content-Length hard?

  = You can't look at a file and tell whether it's in BSD format or
    Content-Length format (the presence of the CL headers doesn't 
    actually tell you anything.)

  = If you're in a world where you can't really make assumptions about
    how many bytes a line terminator is (as all of our code is, since
    so far we've managed to support input with CR, LF, and CRLF on all
    platforms, regardless of which is native) you will often find
    yourself faced with Content-Length lines that no longer match, so
    your parser has to do sophisticated error recovery.

  = We are currently writing out-of-spec BSD files anyway -- we are
    treating "\nFrom " as a delimiter, when really we should be 
    treating "\n\nFrom " as a delimiter.  This messes with the lengths,
    so that would have to be fixed first (there's a bug about it.)

RFCs specify internet protocols, that is, on-the-wire formats.  The
thing that the original poster is looking for is a description of the
BSD Mailbox file format (which is not something an RFC would cover.)

But, here's the good news, there *is* no true specification of this file
format, just a collection of word-of-mouth behaviors of the various
programs over the last few decades which have used that format.

Essentially the only safe way to parse that file format is to consider
all lines which begin with the characters "From " (From-space), which
are preceeded by a blank line or beginning-of-file, to be the division
between messages.  That is, the delimiter is "\n\nFrom .*\n" except for
the very first message in the file, where it is "^From .*\n".

Some people will tell you that you should do stricter parsing on those
lines: check for user names and dates and so on.  They are wrong.  The
random crap that has traditionally been dumped into that line is without
bound; comparing the first five characters is the only safe and portable
thing to do.  *Usually*, but not always, the next token on the line
after "From " will be a user-id, or email address, or UUCP path, and
*usually* the next thing on the line will be a date specification, in
*some* format, and *usually* there's nothing after that.  But you can't
rely on any of this.

In the BSD format, the only safe way to add a message to a file is to
mangle occurences of the "From " delimiter in the body of messages to
some other string, usually ">From ".  This is mangling, not quoting,
because it's not a reversible process (since ">From " is not also
quoted.)

Now, there are actually two very similar-looking file formats.  One is
the BSD format, which I've described.  The other, which one might as
well call the "content-length" format, is used by some SYSV-derived
systems, notably Solaris.  It's very similar, but subtly incompatible.
This format does not quote "From " lines, but instead relies on a
Content-Length header in the message proper to indicate the exact
byte-position of the end of each message.  

This latter format is non-portable, easily-corruptible, and overall,
brain-damaged (that's a technical term.)  But I'll refrain from ranting
about it again right now...

I'm not sure exactly what you're trying to say, but I'll clarify what I
meant: I'm not saying that the BSD Mailbox format is *good*.  Just that
the Content-Length variant of that format is *worse*.

Ok, so someone took the From_ format, and extended it to not require
mangling by adding a length indicator to the format.  At first glance,
this may sound simple and elegant, but it breaks the world, and one
shouldn't encourage its use to spread.

The thing that breaks is taking an existing, widely-implemented format,
and *adding* a requirement that it have a length indicator.  This means
that any existing software that already *thinks* it knows how to
manipulate that format is going to damage the file (any change to the
data will cause the length indicator to be wrong w.r.t.  the *new*
specification but not w.r.t. the *old* specification.)

If the content-length-based format was not otherwise-indistinguishable
from the "From " format, there wouldn't be a problem; the old software
would simply fail to work with this new file format, instead of 
"corrupting" the documents (in quotes, because it's really just a 
matter of which spec you're following.)

Also, mailboxes are by their nature a textual format; but, the
content-length header measures in *bytes* rather than lines.  This
means that if you move the file to a system which has a different
end-of-line representation (Windows <=> Mac, or Windows <=> Unix) then
the content-lengths will suddenly be wrong, because the linebreaks now
take two bytes instead of one, or vice versa.

It's impossible for a mail client to look at a file, and tell which of
the two formats (From_ or Content-Length) it is in; they are
programatically indistinguishable.  The presence of a Content-Length
header is not enough, because suppose you were on a system which knew
nothing at all about that header, and some *incoming* message just
happened to have that header in it.  Then that header would end up in
your mailbox (because nobody would have known to remove or recalculate
it), and it would possibly be incorrect.  (Presume further that the
header was not just incorrect, but intentionally malicious...)

Stricter parsing of the "From " separator line doesn't help either,
because there are many, many variations on what goes in that line
(since it was never standardized either); and also, some mail readers
include that line verbatim when forwarding messages (Sun's MailTool,
for example) so a stricter parser wouldn't help that case at all,
because message bodies tend to contain "valid" matches.

Some mail readers attempt to cope with this by recognising the case
where the Content-Length is not obviously spot-on-target, and then
searching forward and backward for the nearest message delimiter; but
this is obviously not foolproof, and makes one's parser much more
inefficient (requiring arbitrary lookahead and backtracking.)

Conventional wisdom is, ``if you believe the Content-Length header,
I've got a bridge to sell you.''

As migration approached, two elderly vultures doubted they could make
the trip south, so they decided to go by airplane.

When they checked their baggage, the attendant noticed that they were
carrying two dead raccoons.  "Do you wish to check the raccoons
through as luggage?" she asked.

"No, thanks," replied the vultures.  "They're carrion."
