/*| nsIMdbCursor: base cursor class for iterating row cells and table rows
**|
**|| count: the number of elements in the collection (table or row)
**|
**|| seed: the change count in the underlying collection, which is synced
**| with the collection when the iteration position is set, and henceforth
**| acts to show whether the iter has lost collection synchronization, in
**| case it matters to clients whether any change happens during iteration.
**|
**|| pos: the position of the current element in the collection.  Negative
**| means a position logically before the first element.  A positive value
**| equal to count (or larger) implies a position after the last element.
**| To iterate over all elements, set the position to negative, so subsequent
**| calls to any 'next' method will access the first collection element.
**|
**|| doFailOnSeedOutOfSync: whether a cursor should return an error if the
**| cursor's snapshot of a table's seed becomes stale with respect the table's
**| current seed value (which implies the iteration is less than total) in
**| between to cursor calls that actually access collection content.  By
**| default, a cursor should assume this attribute is false until specified,
**| so that iterations quietly try to re-sync when they loose coherence.
