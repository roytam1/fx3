/*| nsIMdbErrorHook: a base class for clients of this API to subclass, in order
**| to provide a callback installable in nsIMdbEnv for error notifications. If
**| apps that subclass nsIMdbErrorHook wish to maintain a reference to the env
**| that contains the hook, then this should be a weak ref to avoid cycles.
**|
**|| OnError: when nsIMdbEnv has an error condition that causes the total count
**| of errors to increase, then nsIMdbEnv should call OnError() to report the
**| error in some fashion when an instance of nsIMdbErrorHook is installed.  The
**| variety of string flavors is currently due to the uncertainty here in the
**| nsIMdbBlob and nsIMdbCell interfaces.  (Note that overloading by using the
**| same method name is not necessary here, and potentially less clear.)
