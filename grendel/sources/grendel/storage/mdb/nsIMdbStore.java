/*| nsIMdbStore: a mutable interface to a specific database file.
**|
**|| tables: one can force a new table to exist in a store with NewTable()
**| and nonzero values for both row scope and table kind.  (If one wishes only
**| one table of a certain kind, then one might look for it first using the
**| GetTableKind() method).  One can pass inMustBeUnique to force future
**| users of this store to be unable to create other tables with the same pair
**| of scope and kind attributes.  When inMustBeUnique is true, and the table
**| with the given scope and kind pair already exists, then the existing one
**| is returned instead of making a new table.  Similarly, if one passes false
**| for inMustBeUnique, but the table kind has already been marked unique by a
**| previous user of the store, then the existing unique table is returned.
**|
**|| import: all or some of another port's content can be imported by calling
**| AddPortContent() with a row scope identifying the extent of content to
**| be imported.  A zero row scope will import everything.  A nonzero row
**| scope will only import tables with a matching row scope.  Note that one
**| must somehow find a way to negotiate possible conflicts between existing
**| row content and imported row content, and this involves a specific kind of
**| definition for row identity involving either row IDs or unique attributes,
**| or some combination of these two.  At the moment I am just going to wave
**| my hands, and say the default behavior is to assign all new row identities
**| to all imported content, which will result in no merging of content; this
**| must change later because it is unacceptable in some contexts.
**|
**|| commits: to manage modifications in a mutable store, very few methods are
**| really needed to indicate global policy choices that are independent of 
**| the actual modifications that happen in objects at the level of tables,
**| rows, and cells, etc.  The most important policy to specify is which sets
**| of changes are considered associated in a manner such that they should be
**| applied together atomically to a given store.  We call each such group of
**| changes a transaction.  We handle three different grades of transaction,
**| but they differ only in semantic significance to the application, and are
**| not intended to nest.  (If small transactions were nested inside large
**| transactions, that would imply that a single large transaction must be
**| atomic over all the contained small transactions; but actually we intend
**| smalls transaction never be undone once commited due to, say, aborting a
**| transaction of greater significance.)  The small, large, and session level
**| commits have equal granularity, and differ only in risk of loss from the
**| perspective of an application.  Small commits characterize changes that
**| can be lost with relatively small risk, so small transactions can delay
**| until later if they are expensive or impractical to commit.  Large commits
**| involve changes that would probably inconvenience users if lost, so the
**| need to pay costs of writing is rather greater than with small commits.
**| Session commits are last ditch attempts to save outstanding changes before
**| stopping the use of a particular database, so there will be no later point
**| in time to save changes that have been delayed due to possible high cost.
**| If large commits are never delayed, then a session commit has about the
**| same performance effect as another large commit; but if small and large
**| commits are always delayed, then a session commit is likely to be rather
**| expensive as a runtime cost compared to any earlier database usage.
**|
**|| aborts: the only way to abort changes to a store is by closing the store.
**| So there is no specific method for causing any abort.  Stores must discard
**| all changes made that are uncommited when a store is closed.  This design
**| choice makes the implementations of tables, rows, and cells much less
**| complex because they need not maintain a record of undobable changes.  When
**| a store is closed, presumably this precipitates the closure of all tables,
**| rows, and cells in the store as well.   So an application can revert the
**| state of a store in the user interface by quietly closing and reopening a
**| store, because this will discard uncommited changes and show old content.
**| This implies an app that closes a store will need to send a "scramble"
**| event notification to any views that depend on old discarded content.
