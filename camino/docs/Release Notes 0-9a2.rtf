\f0\b\fs30 \cf2 Camino 0.9alpha1 Release Notes\

\f1\b0\fs20 \cf2 Camino 0.9 brings you a heavily updated version of the only native OS X browser using Mozilla.org's Gecko HTML rendering engine. We made great improvements in rendering accuracy and speed, bookmarks and history management, preferences, plugin support, and many other areas.\
Due to changes in our feature set we can no longer support OS X 10.1, we advise people still using OS X 10.1 to download Camino 0.8.4.\
Note that Camino 0.9 is in the "alpha" stage, which means it is still heavily under development. We feel that it is usable on a day-to-day basis and a large improvement over Camino 0.8.4, but you may still experience issues and functionality that doesn't work 100%. The goal of this early release is to demonstrate the team's progress and for people to report issues early on in the development cycle so they can be addressed.\

\f1\b0\fs20 \cf2 	\'a5	Due to a combination of several redraw issues in Gecko typing in form fields can be very slow. Turning of GIF animations can in some cases improve performance.\
	\'a5	By default Shockwave Director content displays at the wrong location in the window, change hardware rendering to software rendering to solve this.\
	\'a5	If you try to open Camino AppleScript dictionary, say from Script Editor, you\'d5ll get an error. To work around this, open the application package, and remove the \'d2Localized.rsrc\'d3 file in Contents/Resources/English.lproj. This will, however, prevent Shockwave Director content from loading so we recommend you do this on a copy of the application.\
