This README documents the Java Enhancers to the Mozilla web browser.

Currently, the only active sub-project is the Webclient Java API to the
Mozilla web browser.  This project also leverages the JavaDOM
sub-project.

Requirements:

* J2SDK 1.3.1 or later

* Apache ant 1.4.1 or later.  If running under J2SDK 1.4.2 or later, you
  need ant 1.6.1, due to javah issues.

* Successfully built debug enabled Mozilla 1.6 tree

How To Build:

* cd to the directory above your top level mozilla directory and cvs
  checkout the Webclient module.

* Modify mozilla/allmakefiles.sh and prepend the contents of the file
  "makefiles", in this directory, to add_makefiles section after the
  "Common makfiles used by everyone" comment.

* re-run ./configure to generate the java makefiles

* put the "mozilla/dist/bin" directory in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Unix,
  or PATH on Win32.

* set the value of the environment var MOZ_JDKHOME to be your J2SDK
  directory.

* Create a build.properties file in the mozilla/java directory with the
  following contents.

######
build.unix.classes=true
build.win32.classes=false
build.home=/home/edburns/Projects/mozilla/MOZILLA_1_4/mozilla/dist/classes
compile.debug=true
######

  Of course, set the values of the above properties correctly according
  to your system.

* run "ant" in the mozilla/java directory.  This will build webclient
  and all dependent libraries.  

How to run the Junit tests:

* Make sure junit.jar is properly set in your mozilla/java/build.properties

* Make sure junit.jar is installed in your $ANT_HOME/lib directory

* Set the following variables in your environment

NSPR_LOG_MODULES=webclient:4,webclientstub:4
NSPR_LOG_FILE=logfile.txt

* cd to mozilla/java/webclient

* Kill any running mozilla instances.  These will mess up the
  profilemanager code.

* run ant test

How to run the test browser (broken as of this writing):

* cd to mozilla/java/webclient/src_moz and run the "runem" batch file to
  run the test browser.
