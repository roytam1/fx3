o Convert to using IDL and GenericFactories. Once support for
  ComponentLoaders is implemented in xpcom, use that to load our
  component.

  [5d]

o Use OJI to obtain the JVM.

  [5d. Awaiting OJI availability]

o i18n the API

o Use nsISupportsProxies to work around thread 
  limitations. This will mean writing an IDL for nsIJavaDOM.h, but 
  that sould be trivial. Documentation for nsISupportsProxies is 
  available at
  http://www.mozilla.org/projects/xpcom/Proxies.html.

o Investigate the possibility of writing a tool that can generate the
  JNI code from idl. This is the only practical way to implement the
  HTML DOM (because it is too big to hand-code).
