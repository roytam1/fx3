<p>Classes to access access and manipulate the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/dom2-javadoc/">W3C DOM</a> of the
current page.</p>

<p>The normal way to gain access to the dom is by calling {@link
org.mozilla.webclient.CurrentPage#getDOM}.  This returns an <code><a
href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/dom2-javadoc/org/w3c/dom/Document.html">org.w3c.dom.Document</a></code>
instance which can be manipulated and inspected as desired.</code></p>
