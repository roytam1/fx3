	* This change fixes
 	http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15793 which caused one
 	to have to copy the component.reg and components directory.  It
 	also causes webclient to do autoregistration.  It also adds a
 	debugging method to BrowserControlMozillaShim.java
 	nativeDebugBreak().

	This changes makes webclient depend on having mozilla sources from
 	10/5/99 or later.
