/**
 * this class created for 3 reasons:
 *  - to hide from extension developers sun.applet.* classes
 *  - to give extension developers basic point for security decisions, like
 *    security code can do: 
 *    sm = System.getSecurityManager();
 *    if (sm instanceof sun.jvmp.applet.WFAppletSecurityManager)
 *     {
 *        Class[] clazz = mgr.getExecutionStackContext();
 *        and return codesource properly
 *     }
 *  - to allow fix bugs in sun.applet.* security manager
