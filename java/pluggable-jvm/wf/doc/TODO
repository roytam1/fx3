1. Netscape 4 build is broken, as I see no reasons to work on it (very tight
   in time). 
   If someone wishes to do it - please note that on Unix you need to run JVM
   in separate process. It's bad for speed. Also you need to complete remote
   bridge shmtran.[ch] as it shouldn't work for calls like
   NC->Java->NC for now. It's not too hard, you just need to poll on proper 
   SHM queue
   when waiting for completion of the call, and if something has come - 
   process it.

2. Rewrite code borrowed from Java Plugin and remove dead code.

3. Add handler for access to browser-provided protocols from applets
   (most obvious HTTPS).

4. Complete Waterfall own security model - maybe just get rid of capabilies 
   at all, if I'll see no use of it.
