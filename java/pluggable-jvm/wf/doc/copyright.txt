            Copyright issues with Waterfall.

COPYRIGTH POLICY:
 Waterfall intended to be GPL'ed, or maybe MPL'ed.

DEPENDNCIES:
 This product was inspired by Java Plugin (and designed to replace it) 
so I used some of Java Plugin code. Code itself is licensed under Sun's JDK 
license. So to obtain clean GPL'ed implementation we need:
 - rewrite applet viewer (sun/jvmp/applet)
 - rewrite Java LiveConnect related code in Mozilla extension (C code is clean)
   but Mozilla extension isn't official part of Waterfall.
