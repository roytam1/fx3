	suite must be used.

		lines are ignored. The key features described 
		as this :

		KeyName = KeyValue

		generator utility searches for such a strings 
		and inserts Key values into the key names fields
		as it describes in the template section.

	3.2 Template file

		The template file is a simple file, that uses
		signs as following to insert the key values 
		into the text. Here comes the example.

		- Example 1

		See some text is goes and Oo-<here>-oO we will insert
		the "here" key value, that goes from the input file

		-

		file like this :

		- Example 2

		# "Here" key
		here = my own value

		-

		The output will be like this :

		- Example 3
