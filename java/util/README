========================================================================
Win32 Build Directions:
========================================================================
Requirements:

* JDK1.1.7 or greater (may work with lower versions, haven't checked).

* M8 or post M8 mozilla tree

* Perl 5 perl.exe must be in your path

How To Build:

* Follow the directions in ..\README

* type "nmake /f makefile.win all" and hope for the best

* this should compile the clasess into %MOZ_SRC%\dist\classes

========================================================================
Unix Build Directions 
========================================================================
Requirements:

* built M8 mozilla tree for some variant of Unix

* JDK1.1.7 or above

How To Build:

* set JDKHOME to where your JDK install directory resides 
	-> setenv JDKHOME /usr/local/jdk1.2

* type "make -f Makefile.unix" and hope for the best
	-> make -f Makefile.unix

* this should compile the clasess into <your mozilla dir>\dist\classes

Problems:

* clobber_all doesn't remove the .class files from dist\classes.  You
  have to do this manually.

* post to netscape.public.mozilla.java newsgroup

General notes:

* Please update the ChangeLog (changelo) when you make changes.
