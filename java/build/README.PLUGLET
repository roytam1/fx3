Win32 Directions:
========================================================================
Requirements:

* current mozilla built tree

* JDK1.3 or JDK1.2 if you are not using OJI

* Perl 5 perl.exe must be in your path

How To Build:

*  make sure the environment var JDKHOME is set to your jdk installation
   directory, ie SET JDKHOME=C:\jdk1.2

* if you do not have working OJI set OJI_DISABLE to 1
  (You can do it in your command prompt, or you can set it in 
   mozilla/java/plugins/src/makefile.win).

* type "nmake /f makefile.win"

How to Run:

* Add following directories to to your path:
  %MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME%
  In case OJI_DISABLE add %JDKHOME%\jre\bin\client to your path

* Copy class files from mozilla/dist/classes to your JRE/lib/ext directory and
add JRE/lib/ext to your classpath
 
How to build and run test
* go to the test directory and type "nmake /f makefile.win"

* Set PLUGLET environment to the  directory you have test.jar

* Run mozilla and load page test.html from test directory and if everething is ok you will see
  some awt demo.

* Add following directories to to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH:

$MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME:$JDKHOME/jre/lib/$HOSTTYPE/native_threads:$JDKHOME/jre/lib/$HOSTTYPE/client:
$JDKHOME/jre/lib/$HOSTTYPE/:

How to Run:
	 
* Add $MOZILLA_FILE_HOME/../classes to your CLASSPATH
