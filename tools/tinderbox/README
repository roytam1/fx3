Tinderbox example for SeaMonkey build
=====================================

Here is an example of how to set up a "SeaMonkey" tinderbox
build of mozilla.

  # Create tinderbox source files in mozilla,
  # then SeaMonkey directory where mozilla tree will live.
  cvs co mozilla/tools/tinderbox
  mkdir SeaMonkey
  cd SeaMonkey; ../mozilla/tools/tinderbox/install-links

  #
  # Create tinder-config.pl file in SeaMonkey directory.  
  # Copy one from an existing build, or create a sample one and edit it:
  #
  ./build-seamonkey.pl --example-config > tinder-config.pl

  #
  # mozconfig.  If you have configure options, add them to a
  # file named "mozconfig" in the SeaMonkey directory.
  # Again, you can copy one from a build, or create one.
  # For a default stock build, this file is not needed or
  # can be blank.
  #

  # Start the tinderbox!  From the SeaMonkey directory:
  ./tinderbox depend start

  # You can watch the build run the first time with:
  tail -f <objdir>/<logname>
